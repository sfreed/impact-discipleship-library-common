// see fulfillment-steps.ts for the label/step-number mapping. Set
// automatically on order creation (server-side, see
// functions/src/purchase-fulfillment.functions.ts) - 'new' if the order has
// a physical line item, 'closed' otherwise (ebook/digital/event-only orders
// have nothing to ship, so they're already done); every other transition
// past that is a manual admin action. 'received' -> 'closed' is a valid
// direct jump (the pickup/hand-delivery override - skips shipping-label/
// packaging entirely).
//
// This is the only order-status field a purchase carries now - there used
// to be a separate CheckoutForm.processedStatus (payment state: NEW/
// COMPLETE/REFUNDED), removed in favor of this one being set on every
// purchase unconditionally. Still distinct from newRecordStatus below (the
// new-record alert badge) - a different, unrelated concern that happens to
